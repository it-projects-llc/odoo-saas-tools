Hi everyone and thank you for being with us all this *dark times*. Today we are happy to announce, that we launched two websites where you can find all information about **Odoo SaaS Tools** project. I hope, that it's much more convenient to get (and add) documentation, check news and plans about the project. Enjoy and feel free to contribute!

## Main website (at github.io)

[it-projects-llc.github.io/odoo-saas-tools](https://it-projects-llc.github.io/odoo-saas-tools/)

* Home page
* Getting Started page 
* Blog for news, plans and FAQs

## Documentation (at readthedocs.io)

[odoo-saas-tools.readthedocs.io](https://odoo-saas-tools.readthedocs.io/)

Documentation splitted by versions (*8.0*, *9.0*, *10.0*, etc)
