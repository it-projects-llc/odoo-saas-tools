SaaS Portal Sale Subscription
=============================

This module complements *SaaS Portal Sale* and *SaaS Portal
Subscription* to improve the management of subscriptions sold:

* Enables subscription period as product attribute.
* Adds subscription invoices to SaaS clients.
* The expiration date also takes into account period paid from invoices.
* Emails are sent to customers to create SaaS clients on pay invoices.
* SaaS client contracts are configured based on first invoices.
* Recurring invoices extend SaaS client subscriptions.
* Trials become subscriptions on validate invoices if plans allow it.
